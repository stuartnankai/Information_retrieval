The battle of Arawe was fought between Japanes and Allied forces as a part of the New Britain (the largest island of what is today Papua New Guinea) Campaign in the Pacific theater during World War II. Rabaul, the capital of New Britain, was a major base for the Japanese military in the area, and in 1943, the Allies initiated an offensive to contain the numerous Japanese forces there. Although the offensive on Arawe was largely a diversion from other parts of Operation Cartwheel, the Allies were able to secure Arawe after roughly a month of fighting, and the Japanese forces withdrew from the area another month later. It has been questioned whether the battle was really necessary, or if the Allied troops could have been of more use elsewhere.
