Automatic summarization is the process of using computers to create short summaries of longer texts. It is part of the machine learning and data mining fields. The general idea is to use information from the text to create the summary. Either by extracting information and generating sentences based on it, or just extracting key sentences. There are many different approaches, both using supervised and unsupervised learning. Automatic summarization is closely related to keyphrase generation.
