Chick-fil-A is a fast food restaurant chain specializing in chicken sandwiches that was founded in 1946 by S. Truett Cathy. It's United States based, where it has around 2,000 restaurants, most of which are in the south. Their slogan is "Eat Mor Chikin", most often depicted on signs held by cows. The company's culture is largely influenced by the founder's Baptist beliefs, and because of that, all restaurants are closed on Sundays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. In January of 2011, the company was the target of a boycott after donations to anti gay marriage causes were revealed.
