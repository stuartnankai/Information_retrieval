The Japanese force at Arawe suffered much heavier casualties than the Allies. It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack. Initial Allied goals for the landing at Arawe included securing a base for American PT boats and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. He did not believe that this would be the main Allied effort in western New Britain, however. The process of unloading ships at Arawe was hampered by air attacks and congestion on House Fireman Beach.

This is an order of battle listing the Allied and Japanese forces involved in the Battle of Arawe from 15 December 1943 to 24 February 1944. The Battle of Arawe (also known as Operation Director) was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the New Britain Campaign of World War II. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region at the time of the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15 December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force. The battle formed part of the Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943.

The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15 December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational.

Examples of these include image collection summarization and video summarization. Image collection summarization is other application example of automatic summarization. There are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. Other examples include document summarization, image collection summarization and video summarization. A promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization.

Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. The different types of automatic summarization include extraction-based, abstraction-based, maximum entropy-based, and aided summarization. Automatic data summarization is part of machine learning and data mining. Sentence extraction is a technique used for automatic summarization of a text. There are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on.
