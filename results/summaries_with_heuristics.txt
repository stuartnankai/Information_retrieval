The Battle of Arawe also known as Operation Director was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the New Britain Campaign of World War II. The battle formed part of the Allied Operation Cartwheel and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain and was reinforcing the region at the time of the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15 December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force. In July 1942 the US Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that the main objective of the Allied forces in the South Pacific and Southwest Pacific area commands was to capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul on the eastern tip of New Britain.

Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document. Automatic data summarization is part of machine learning and data mining. Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as length writing style and syntax. The main idea of summarization is to find a representative subset of the data which contains the information of the entire set. The different types of automatic summarization include extractionbased abstractionbased maximum entropybased and aided summarization.
