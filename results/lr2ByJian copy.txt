The Allied air forces began pre-invasion raids on western New Britain on 13 November.
As "A" Troop had lost all of its weapons and other equipment during the landing attempt at Umtingalu, supplies were air-dropped into the beachhead during the afternoon of 16 December to re-equip the unit.
He did not believe that this would be the main Allied effort in western New Britain, however.
The 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, stationed at Cape Bushing on the south coast of New Britain about 40 mi (64 km) east of Arawe was also directed to move by sea to counter the Allied invasion.
A platoon from "C" Troop also made an unsuccessful patrol from the western end of the MLR during which it suffered six casualties from Japanese machine gun and rifle fire.

We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents.
The edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap.
For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document.
Submodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks.
Sentence extraction is a technique used for automatic summarization of a text.

Extractive methods work by selecting a subset of existing words, phrases, or sentences in the original text to form the summary.
An example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document.
Image collection summarization is other application example of automatic summarization.
For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices.
Submodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks.
