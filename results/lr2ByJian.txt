Other examples include document summarization, image collection summarization and video summarization. Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document.High-order n-gram rouge measures try to judge fluency to some degree. For example, automatic summarization research on medical text generally attempts to utilize the various sources of codified medical knowledge and ontologies. While some work has been done in abstractive summarization (creating an abstract synopsis like that of a human), the majority of summarization systems are extractive (selecting a subset of sentences to place in a summary).
